# hello_world

If you have a branch set up to track a remote branch (see the next section
and 
Chapter 3
 for more information), you can use the 
git pull
command to
automatically fetch and then merge a remote branch into your current branch.
This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default,
the 
git clone
 command automatically sets up your local master branch to
track the remote master branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on
the server you cloned from. Running 
git pull
generally fetches data from the
server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the
code you’re currently working on
